# Casentinoday2020AmigaDemo

This is a small and simple invitation intro for Casentino day 2020, a small gathering in central Italy meant for Amiga enthusiasts that takes place every year in late summer (usually last week of August).   
Actually this yea, Casentino day turned into an online only event due Coronavirus concerns.

The  intro has been tested on real Amigas with following configurations:

- Amiga 1200 with ACA1221EC
- Amiga 600 stock with 2mb pcmcia fast ram
- Amiga 600 with vampireV2 accellerator
- Amiga 500 plus with ACA500+

It should run on any Amiga classic as long it's equipped with at least 1MB CHIP RAM + 1MB fast ram.   
For more information about us and if you are interested in our activities go to https://vampireitalia.forumfree.it/ .  

### How to run this stuff on a real amiga
Download the adf file from the github releases section or just copy the executable somewhere in your Amiga harddrive and run it (but you will miss the boot screen).
